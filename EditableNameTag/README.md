# Bind to a property
In addition to text content, you can bind to an element’s _properties_ (using `property-name="{{binding}}"`). Polymer properties can optionally support two-way binding.

This example uses two-way binding: binding the value of a custom input element (`iron-input`) to the element’s **owner** property, so it’s updated as the user types.
